There are few things sadder than an unlabeled (or poorly labeled) dataset.
Without names, data access becomes inordinately more difficult or even impossible.
In this paper we describe the first steps towards building a new tool that makes it easier for users to properly label data, and to help preserve those labels for future use.
Specifically, we outline the design of \systemname, a knowledge-base for storing column-naming heuristics, as well as an interactive tool: the \systemname editor for populating the knowledge-base.  
The \systemname editor primes the knowledge base by learning from example data (e.g., from open data portals), and assists domain experts in reviewing and refining the resulting heuristic naming schemes.
We identify specific issues arising from training and show how the \systemname editor streamlines the process of manually repairing these issues.
