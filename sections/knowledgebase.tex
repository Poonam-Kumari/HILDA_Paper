\subsection{Types of Matching Rules}

\tinysection{Approximate}


Outline approximate matching rules: Expert heuristics, rules, etc...
\begin{itemize}
  \item How are approximate KB entries encoded?
  \item How do we unify different types of heuristics?
\end{itemize}


\tinysection{Exact}

Outline exact matching rules: Data identity, recording/querying feedback.  Merging conflicts.

\begin{itemize}
  \item How is feedback saved in the KB.
  \item What happens in response to conflicting feedback.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Data Sketching for Similarity}
Overview sketching data for similarity.  

Data type taxonomy
\begin{itemize}
  \item Numeric Data (Sketch = Distribution)
  \item Textual Data (N-Gram distribution?, )
  \item Enum Types (Overlap, Concept-Similarity)
  \item ...?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Numeric Data}
Focus on the challenges of sketching numeric types
